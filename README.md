#Hi, I’m @MarvHetz

Currently I am doing an apprentice ship at a school in Germany, where I learn all the necessary skills to be a good programmer.
So all most of my Repositories are only for me to work along from home.

MarvHetz/MarvHetz is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
